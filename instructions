Prerequisites
- PHP 8.2+
- Composer
- Node.js 18+
- Optional: WAMP/XAMPP (Apache) if not using artisan serve

Database setup
- Default: SQLite (already configured in .env)
  - No extra setup needed; migrations will create tables in database/database.sqlite

  - Update .env with DB_CONNECTION=mysql and credentials, then run migrations
  - Or import schema directly: mysql -u root -p < schema.sql

Install & build
- composer install
- cp .env.example .env (if not present)
- php artisan key:generate
- php artisan migrate
- npm install
- npm run build (or npm run dev for Vite)

Run the web app (development)
- php artisan serve
- Open http://127.0.0.1:8000
- If using WAMP/Apache: point DocumentRoot to /public (e.g., http://localhost/dergawi/public)
